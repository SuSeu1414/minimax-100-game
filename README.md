# minimax-100-game

## About 100! game
The main goal of the game is to be the last person who adds a number so the outcome is 100 or more. You can add numbers from 1 to 9, you can't skip turns - you always have to add a number. That's all.

## Minimax algorithm
My AI uses a minimax algorithm which can be shown as a tree search for the best move. It's not really efficient. but I was just curious how to always win the 100! game.

## Observations
You can always win the 100! game as a second player. The main goal is to add a number so the last digit of the outcome is 0.
```
to 7 you should add 3 so the outcome is 10.
to 12 you should add 8 so the outcome is 20.
etc
```
